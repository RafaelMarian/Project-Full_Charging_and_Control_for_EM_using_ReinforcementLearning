# Disertatie Electrical Motor control (F.O.C) and charging system  updated with Reinforcement Learning and Model Prediction Control

The project containts the Field Oriented Control implementation for motor control but instead of using a simple PI controller we replaced it with an Reinforcement Learning module.
Model prodiction control was used to predict the open and close state of the transitor for the DC-DC Boost component.
The entire logic for control and charging was implemented and can be run and studied.
